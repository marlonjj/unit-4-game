# unit-4-game
Howdy partners!

This project is a game called Gem Collector (in the style of Crystal Collector) I created during the second week of my coding bootcamp with Trilogy at UC Berkeley Extension


It is all created by yours truly, Marlon Jovez, with the inspiration of the program and our teacher, David Hallinan.
